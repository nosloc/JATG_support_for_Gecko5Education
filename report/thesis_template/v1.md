Antoine Colson 

## Introduction 

1. Aim of this project 
2. Main challenges
   1. Lack of documentation
   2. Not anything already done on this specific board 
   3. The existing interface is very simplistic
3. Goals of this project how did i approach this project 
   1. Milestone 1: Communicate with the board
   2. Milestone 2: Write to the DRAM using this specific interface
4. One sentence to describe the project 
5. Highlight of some result :
   1. Being able to communicate with the board and implement anything wanted 
   2. Reading writting to any components on the bus architecture
6. As a result in the rest of this report i'll explain the features i addded to the current prototype and how i made them work on the board

## Design

1. Existing interface : JTAGG
   1. Already implemented in every ECP5 Lattice FPGA
   *Figure: JTAGG component*
   2. Explanation of the different ports 
   3. The principle of custom instructions 
      1. how implemented
      2. how to used them
    
### First Design for the Milestone one

0. Refresher on the objectives of the milestone
1. Explanation of what is called the IPcore 
   1. Bridge between the custom instructions and the board/architecture
   2. Design to prove it can be used to do somthing concrete on the board
      1. Goal command the led array
      2. assign both instructions to the value of either the RGB values or the column choosed
2. brief resume of the full hardware design for part 1 
*Figures: Full design*
3. Communicating with the actual board
   1. Laod the design on the board (lpgf file modifictation)
   *Code modification of the lpgf file*
   2. Communicate via the JTAG interface: OpenOcd
   3. how it works 
      1. local host server
      2. low jtag level instructions
      3. why shifting in +1 bit rather than the exact number of bit

### Second Design for milestone two

0. Refresher on the objectives of the milestone (component named JTAG_interface)
1. summarize the overall design 
2. Enter more in details
    1. Bus architecture
        1. shared bus principle
    *Table: bus signal*
    2. refactoring ipcore
        1. role in the newe architecture
        2. set of instructions *Table of instruction*
        3. from two chains to a single one
    3. pingpong buffer
        *Figure: buffer implementation*
        1. Role in the architecture
        2. pros for using this type
        3. two modules can acces in at same time
        4. handle two different clock domains
        5. Easy to switch the buffer just change the most significant bit
    4. DMA controller
        1. Role in the architecture 
        2. ports input/output *Figure : block design of the component*
        3. supported operations
    5. Custom instruction ??
2. Two clock domains issue 
   1. Synchronization between the two domains

### Logic anyliser ??

## The implementation

### First design 

1. Ipcore : 
    1. one component for each instruction
    2. usage of shift register as in the JTAGG component 
       1. How leds actually work on the board (active low) *Figrue: Leds on the board*
       2. shift reg/ shadow reg to keep the old data when shifting new data in 

### Second design 

1. IPcore: 
   1. The use of the FSM to control the state
   *Figure : FSM*
   2. the use of the shift register
   3. the status register 
   4. How do we concretely get back data from the ipcore through the JTAG
   5. the cycle/instrcutions delays associated with te instructions and why
2. Clock synchronizer
    *Figure: implementation design*
   - 3 of them : two for starting the DMA, one for the IPcore ro say when it is free and when it's not ??
3. Pingpong buffer 
   1. Size of it and why
   2. way to access it 
   3. how to handle the switch
4. The DMA controller:
   1. **TO DO when the DMA will be working**
   2. The arguments passes by the DMA (block size, burst size, address, byte enable)
5. Custom instruction??
6. How concretely added to the whole exixting architecture
    1. connection with the bus architecture
    2. The system clock for the DMA and finally the reset
    3. Mapping to somme signals to the leds of the board ?? (will it stays in the final design ???)
    *Figure: Part of the code ??*

## Evaluation

0. Usage of testbenches for each component added in this project to verify at least on simulation that the component is actually working as expected 

1. Part 1 evaluation : Make everything clean and hide implementation design to the user 
   1. Python script
      1. Very simple command interpreter to choose the light colors of the board
      2. Objectif complete : we are able to use the JTAG interface to communicate with the actual board
      *Figure: example of usage of the interpreter*

2. Part 2 evaluation : Ideally a c program that load a binary on the board. 
3. Evaluation of the speed at which it can load the program on the board compare to the UART interface .

## Conclusion 

1. Summary of the goals and the results 
2. Openeing on what could be done after 
   1. Logic analyser
   2. Debugger for the processor (need to change the processor with one that has debug ports using open ocd and/or gdb)
   3. Anything we want using the second instruction left unused (can reuse the design of the chain1 because very generic)
